# The Hall of Sound

#### Music is the new Fame

#

### Running the project

#

##### - (From the project root folder)

##### - Download all packages with npm install

##### - Run docker-compose up --no-start

##### - Run docker-compose up

##### - Make sure the backend is ready at http://localhost:3000/api-docs/

##### - Run ng serve -o

#

### How to use it?

#

##### By getting lost in it and thinking of music while you do

##### Only the albums can be saved\*\*\* from the "panel" section

##### Ergo, only the albums are listed, in the "albums" section, and the artists section will be empty

##### But I hope you enjoy the journey, as much as I did while coding it!
